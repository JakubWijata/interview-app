# My Books To Read

Flutter project for interview purposes .

## Done

✅ - Firestore integration\
✅ - Firebase Auth integration\
✅ - Github workflow (Tests and build APK)\
✅ - Internationalizing l10n\
✅ - Go router simple routing \
✅ - Rest API integration (Dio, Retrofit)\
✅ - Pagination, Debouncer \
✅ - Tests

## Additional
- Due to the size of the project, I opted for a simple architecture following the data, domain, and presentation layers. This approach keeps the codebase clean and maintainable without adding unnecessary complexity.\
- I decided not to implement pagination for the favorites list. Since favorite books are typically limited in number, pagination doesn’t seem necessary in this case. However, if the dataset were to grow significantly, adding pagination would be recommended to maintain performance and optimize data handling.
